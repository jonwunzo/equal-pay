      <h2>💰 The Revenue Reality</h2>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/FIFA_World_Cup_Revenue_Comparison.png" alt="FIFA World Cup Revenue Comparison" style="max-width:100%; margin: 20px 0;">
      <p>Some athletes, economists, and fans believe that pay in sports should be determined by performance and the money you bring in—not by gender. At the end of the day, they argue, sports are a business. And like any business, compensation should match contribution.</p>
      <p><strong>UFC fighter Ronda Rousey</strong> put it bluntly: “I’m the highest-paid fighter not because they wanted to do something nice for the ladies, but because I bring in the most money.”</p>
      <p>Supporters of this view point to numbers like this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>Men’s World Cup</strong> generated about <strong>$6 billion</strong></li>
        <li>The <strong>Women’s World Cup</strong> brought in <strong>$131 million</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>📜 Looking at the History Behind the Pay Gap</h2>
      <p>But money isn’t the whole story.</p>
      <p>This part of the site explores how the gender pay gap in sports didn’t just “happen.” For a long time, women were completely shut out of sports. And when they were finally let in, they faced huge barriers like limited funding, barely any media attention, and low fan turnout. So, it’s not that women’s sports can’t bring in money—it’s that they’ve never had the same chance to.</p>
      <p>Here, we look at:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>Equal Pay Act of 1963</strong></li>
        <li>Research on <strong>systemic inequality</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Movements</strong> that are trying to change the game</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🌍 What’s Changing and Where We’re Headed</h2>
      <p>So, how do we actually fix this? Good news—there are already signs of progress.</p>
      <p>Big deals are being made, like <strong>Netflix</strong> partnering with FIFA to stream future Women’s World Cups. Leagues like the <strong>NWSL</strong> are changing outdated systems that held women back. And new sponsorships, contracts, and broadcasting rights are starting to shift the playing field.</p>
      <p>This section highlights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Smart solutions that are already in motion</li>
        <li>✅ Collective wins from female athletes</li>
        <li>✅ A future where pay is more fair—not because it was forced, but because the system was rebalanced</li>
      </ul>
